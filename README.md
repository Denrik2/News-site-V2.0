# News-site-V2.0
This is an improved version of the [site](https://github.com/Denrik2/News-site).  
And here is the site itself:  
You can see the changes yourself, but I will duplicate them below.  
- To begin with, I made a news model.
  - Added the ability to edit, delete, group.
- Made registration.
  - I also made it possible to log in with an existing account.
- After all this, I made a front, dealt better with bootstrap (I still don't like doing frontendðŸ˜…).
  - Made a beautiful button animation. Well, the design itself has become many times better compared to previous works.
My next destination is the forum)
